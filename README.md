Challenge completed:

  -Successfully fetching the movies data from an external API:
  
  -Implemented Routing for List and Details Page
  
  -Used Redux to manage the application state
  
  -Designed the frontend using material-ui components
  
  -Developed a responsive design and user friendly UI
  
 Challenge pending:
 
  -create infinite scrolling and paginating the list of movies page 
 
 
 If there is extra time given then I would like to solve the pending challenge and also try testing the app.
